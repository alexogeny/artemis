# Copy this file to `.env` and customise for your environment. Values are read by the quickstart loader
# via `MERE_QUICKSTART_AUTH` or `MERE_QUICKSTART_AUTH_FILE` when running integration servers locally.
#
# Example inline configuration (single-line JSON):
# MERE_QUICKSTART_AUTH={"tenants":[{"slug":"acme","name":"Acme Rockets","users":[{"id":"usr_acme_owner","email":"founder@acme.test","password":"change-me"}]}],"admin":{"users":[{"id":"usr_admin","email":"admin@mere.test","password":"change-me","mfa_code":"123456"}]}}
#
# Example file-based configuration. Point the variable at a JSON file committed outside source control
# (e.g. `quickstart-auth.json`) containing the same payload as above.
# MERE_QUICKSTART_AUTH_FILE=quickstart-auth.json
